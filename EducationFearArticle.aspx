                    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Esen Eyribaş, Oktay Aydın</h2>
                    <p class="lead">In Summary</p>
                    <p class="lead">University students have fears regarding education. Factors triggering these fears include feeling that their education is inadequate, 
                    lacking sufficient self-confidence, believing that jobs in the private sector are too difficult, lacking sufficient knowledge about their future profession, 
                    and not knowing themselves well enough. How can we overcome these fears? To address these fears, voluntary education-oriented projects can be established to 
                    reach students through a website. This website can include topics and examples of interest, goals set by students in education, collaborative projects, idea 
                    development in engineering, statements, job experiences and suggestions from companies in the private sector willing to help students voluntarily, among other 
                    sections. In this way, students can overcome their fears, gain self-confidence, and most importantly, have the opportunity to fill each other's gaps through 
                    knowledge exchange.
                    <br /><br />In the developed project for overcoming our fears, first, a MySQL database is created. This database is designed based on the findings of the site's 
                    pre-planning and analysis stages. To use the database dynamically, a Control Panel is created via the Codeigniter PHP framework, making management easier. This 
                    control panel will handle both the content management of the information presented to users on the website's interface and the dynamization of the MySQL database. 
                    The frontend design of the site is enhanced using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to make it visually appealing. The interface of the site needs to be visually impressive.</p>
                    <p class="lead">1. Introduction</p>  
                    <p class="lead">The desired goal of the project to overcome education fears is to contribute to education in Turkey. For years, there have been discussions about 
                    education in Turkey, students have criticized education, and most importantly, good efforts have been made on various projects but shelved due to various factors 
                    or lack of support. Our aim, however, is to voluntarily conduct analyses on education, with no criticism involved. Through the eyes of a student, efforts will be 
                    made to observe and analyze the difficulties students face in the best possible way.
                    The aim of this project is to provide solutions to difficulties or problems from the perspective of students. Students' anxieties about education stem from various 
                    reasons such as feeling that their education is inadequate, not having sufficient knowledge about their fields of study, needing improvement in engineering thinking, 
                    rote learning, lack of self-confidence, approaching work with a bias of 'I can't do it', fear of the private sector, inability to find enough Turkish resources, 
                    difficulties in understanding lessons if they are taught in a foreign language, and adopting a short-term approach to events. Within the scope of this project, efforts 
                    will be made to minimize these anxieties related to education [12].
                    <br /><br />When looking at the literature, it is evident that the lack of engineering thinking and the persistence of rote learning among students have not yet been 
                    completely overcome. Rote learning is definitely a flawed system that leads students away from education. Engineering is a systematic way of thinking. It is the ability 
                    to think mathematically. Engineering is the effort and power to produce useful creations for humanity through concrete syntheses using reason and experience from all 
                    knowledge obtained through science. Engineering is about optimizing science, economy, time, and physical resources and seeking optimum solutions. Especially the solution 
                    process for these two issues can be overcome through social volunteers, company owners, and sharing of knowledge and experiences among students.
                    The way to solve these problems for students includes providing resources on topics of interest, conducting surveys to make education more consciously accessible, providing
                    comprehensive information about their fields of study, highlighting works that analyze engineering solutions, introducing individuals who have contributed to education and 
                    encouraging students to emulate them, providing information about the private sector to students, and helping students create their own goals. If solutions are provided to 
                    all students through a website, the analyses will be more effective.
                    <br /><br />In the project, it is necessary to prioritize design over software. However, clear and uncomplicated software strengthens the project. In design, innovation can 
                    be brought about by working on emerging branches of science. When we talk about these emerging branches of science, we will first address the concept of 'logo'. The logo has 
                    become essential for all institutionalized organizations. Since logos become more permanent in people's minds and having a logo is inevitable in terms of impressiveness, the 
                    website must have one. The logo will be designed with Tridimax 3D. Careful attention is required in the color harmony of the website. Colors have meanings for humans. Therefore, 
                    color selections for the website should also carry meanings suitable for the purposes of the site, and efforts should be made in this area to choose appropriate colors that leave 
                    a good impression on the user. When the site reaches its target audience, beneficial subliminal messages can also be implemented [7].
                    In terms of education, when we compare ourselves with other countries in the IT sector, we are progressing a bit slowly. This is thought to be due to insufficient emphasis on
                    teamwork. New discoveries remain personal knowledge. With this educational project, collaboration can be increased. It is in our hands to make the internet more efficient and 
                    more useful.</p>
                    <p class="lead">2. Education Anxieties</p>
                    <p class="lead">When we think about education anxieties, the most prominent one is the fear of unemployment. After sixteen years of education, students often feel lost in the 
                    job market. This is mainly due to their distance from the industry. The tasks seem daunting to them. As a solution, collecting data, experiences, and information about the job 
                    market from companies in the private sector who will voluntarily support us and presenting this information to students within this platform would be beneficial [11].
                    Another concern when it comes to education anxieties is students' tendency to think, 'I don't know anything.' To address this, projects will be offered to students to help them 
                    gain confidence. A confident student will contribute to tasks with their knowledge and will be motivated to improve themselves. Additionally, the necessary information will be 
                    provided through collaborative efforts to establish a knowledge base [12].
                    It's everyone's desire to do great things somewhere. Utilizing praise for good purposes, a competitive environment can be created among students. When considering how this can be 
                    achieved, whenever a sample is submitted on the platform or in other projects, the contributor's name is written underneath, and they are recognized as a supporter on the platform. 
                    In the supporters section of the platform, everyone who has contributed will be introduced, utilizing the feeling of pride in a positive way, which will foster a friendly competition.
                    <br /><br />Another fear in the field of education is the insufficient development of engineering thinking skills. When any problem arises, there is a lack of problem-solving ability. 
                    To improve this, articles and papers promoting critical thinking can be published. This way, students will inevitably develop their critical thinking skills.
                    Another concern for students is that they only plan for a certain part of their lives. They are raised with the belief that attending a good primary school will secure admission to a 
                    good high school, attending a good high school will secure admission to a good university, and attending a good university will lead to a good job. However, the concept of a 'good job' 
                    lacks specificity. When students understand a 'good job' upon completing university, it is often interpreted as the highest-paying job. In fact, the concept of a 'good job' should not 
                    be defined in this way. This misconception arises from the ignorance of both families and students. A 'good job' is the one that best suits an individual's personal qualities. However, 
                    in our society, the focus is often on pursuing the highest-paying sector due to the fear of financial instability. This is actually a flawed mindset. Therefore, this platform will also 
                    provide students with clues to understand themselves better by addressing these issues.
                    <br /><br />Students tend to adopt an unplanned lifestyle from a young age. Life is lived as if there is no tomorrow. However, they should have specific goals or objectives they want to 
                    achieve in their lives. Just as states and companies set goals for themselves for a certain period, it is inevitable for students to have life goals. On the platform, by setting educational 
                    goals, students can be encouraged to act more motivated and consciously [11].
                    The student's education anxieties will be identified through analysis and tests, and the platform will be designed in a way that can be expanded as desired. The aim is to make this voluntary
                    education platform as useful as possible. For this reason, it requires a long-term effort.</p><br />
                    <p class="lead">3. The Purpose and Scope of the Education Anxiety Overcoming Project</p> 
                    <p class="lead">The purpose of the Education Anxiety Overcoming Project encompasses several objectives, such as addressing students' problems, advancing in the field of education, and 
                    fostering the creation of more conscientious generations. Improving students' education will contribute to the formation of a better future.
                    The Education Anxiety Overcoming Project can be utilized by students, business owners, and anyone interested in science. This project will create opportunities for learning new information 
                    and will provide a platform for self-improvement without being subject to specific fees.</p> 
                    <p class="lead">4. Benefits of the Education Anxiety Overcoming Project</p> 
                    <p class="lead">If we were to discuss the benefits of the Education Anxiety Overcoming Project, students will be able to address their shortcomings, industry leaders can fulfill this societal 
                    responsibility, and progress in the field of education are just a few of its benefits.
                    Education is a lifelong journey. In the future, when students enter the workforce, they will also have the opportunity to help those who were once in their shoes, and they can obtain this 
                    opportunity through this platform. This is a consciousness. When we look at developed societies, we see the significant impact of mutual assistance on the community. We believe that by 
                    providing assistance in education, positive outcomes can be achieved. Desired development is progress in science. It will be more effective to achieve this not individually but collectively 
                    with the community.
                    <br /><br />It will contribute to the development of high-quality engineers suitable for the private sector. An increase in the quality of work means an increase in the country's development 
                    rate. We anticipate that small efforts will yield significant results. As this project is introduced to the community, voluntary education will increase. In this way, the problems of students 
                    will be largely resolved.</p>
                    <p class="lead"> 5. The Software of the Education Anxiety Overcoming Project</p> 
                    <p class="lead">The software development of the Education Anxiety Overcoming Project begins with downloading the framework from the Codeigniter website [1]. Subsequently, it is uploaded to the
                    web server. Using the web server, a database is created via phpMyAdmin, and the necessary table structure for the database contents is defined. Configuration settings for the framework are adjusted
                    accordingly. Then, the HTML form elements for educational examples are defined in the configuration file to be utilized through the framework. Similar configurations will be made for session 
                    management and database operations [6]. 
                    In the database file located in the config folder, necessary definitions for database connection are made (such as host address, host username, and password). A Control Panel is prepared for managing
                    the site's interface. An admin membership system is implemented for the Control Panel. For the sections where examples of topics can be uploaded, fields for adding/deleting/editing are created for 
                    sections such as education name, topic name, example name, and example content to facilitate usage. Sections such as About Us, Contact, Companies We Work With, Announcements, Statements, Goals are 
                    created. CFK Editor can be used as the text editor.
                    <br /><br />For the site interface, the interface will be designed using HTML with the assistance of CSS [3]. Menus are created with the help of Ajax. These created sections will assist in listing 
                    the content of items in the top menu from the database [4]. Through PHP, the education, topic, example name, and example content on the menus are controlled from the control panel, allowing for the 
                    uploading of content to the database and the flow of information from the database to the site interface [2]. Ensuring the simplicity of the software is the primary goal, aiming to simplify its usability.
                    When looking at the site prepared within the scope of the project, the first noticeable aspect is the color harmony [15]. The combination of red and white stands out. Simplicity is prominent in the menu
                    section. The aim of keeping it simple is to ensure better usability. The main topics are placed in the top menu to highlight their importance [14]. On the left side, two different sections are created by 
                    categorizing the topics. The topics are facilitated with the site's internal search feature to make data retrieval easier. In case of expansion within the project scope, it's essential to maintain the 
                    simplicity and usability of the site [5].<br /><br />The content structure;<br />
                    Homepage: The homepage will feature a promotional text outlining the purpose and goals of the website. <br />

                    The search engine on the left side of the site will allow users to search for example posts within the site [14].</p>
                    <p class="lead">6. The Sample Site We Worked on Within the Scope of the Project</p> 
                    <p class="lead">Within the project scope, to provide a more comfortable working environment and to observe our activities in a data format, a special company purchased hosting and domain space. 
                    We chose the site name as 'tikgep.' When determining the name, we benefited from different sciences. The reason for this is explained in section seven [14].
                    Our website's software and content structure were designed in line with the intended goals. Progress was made according to the plan to minimize time loss. Trials and observations are being
                    conducted on the site layout to use the desired visual elements efficiently. The sample site can be accessed at 'http://tikgep.com'. [14].</p>
                    <p class="lead"> 7. Disciplines Applicable in the Overcoming Our Educational Fears Project</p> 
                    <p class="lead">In the Overcoming Our Educational Fears Project, various disciplines can be utilized. What will these disciplines be? To answer this question, these disciplines will be used
                    in choosing the site's name, designing the logo, incorporating subconscious messages, selecting the site's colors, and designing the layout. The use of different branches of science can increase
                    the effectiveness of the project [8].
                    Let's examine the concepts one by one. First, let's consider the name of the site; it is logical to create the site's name from meaningless words or to encrypt the site's name. The main reason
                    for this is to arouse curiosity about the site's name. People have a curiosity about the unknown. Instinctively, people tend to be more attached to things they don't understand. Survey results show
                    that people are more active on sites whose meanings they know, such as 'Facebook' and 'Twitter'. People will engage in the process of deciphering privacy. The aim here is to advertise the site 
                    effectively, to attract people more easily to this voluntary project, and to enable them to learn more while searching for information about privacy among the examples and topics on the site.
                    Another aspect to consider is the logo design. The logo will add seriousness, quality, and visual appeal to this platform. People will be able to perceive the work done with a sense of responsibility. 
                    Using the Tridimax 3D drawing program, which is widely used by the Graphic Department, will allow us to create better designs for the logo. Aesthetics are crucial in the logo. Additionally, the slopes,
                    colors, and shapes in the logo will be designed based on successful knowledge in this field. The logo should have visual elements that effectively represent this voluntary project [15].
                    <br /><br />Another concept to consider is the subconscious message area. It's important to produce products that will positively influence young people. By thoroughly researching this area, people
                    can be attracted here with subconscious messages that can yield positive results. The aim here is to enhance persuasiveness. Another purpose of subconscious messages is to instill confidence in students. 
                    Through subconscious elements, a sense of confidence can be instilled more easily [7].
                    The subconscious message can be utilized in different areas of the website. Companies that use subconscious messages in their logos exist [16]. When subconscious messages are used in the logo, 
                    it can also impact search engines. Subconscious messages can be researched and applied in different areas of the website [7].
                    As part of the Education Fear Overcoming Project, another science that can be utilized is the creation of color meanings for the website. It is known that colors can affect people's psychology. 
                    The effects of colors have been the subject of many articles and scientific studies. In our website, we will use red, white, and dark gray colors. Let's start by discussing the meaning of the color red. 
                    Red is the most attention-grabbing color. Therefore, it is widely preferred in advertising materials. In addition, it arouses excitement in people. Because it arouses excitement, it appeals more to the 
                    younger generation. Being attention-grabbing and striking, many companies choose red for their logos. It is more suitable to use the color red for menus and logos on the site. As for the other color 
                    we will use, it is white. White is the color of innocence. It reminds of cleanliness and clarity. In education, it is a clean development area. The background color of our website and the categories 
                    on the menus will be white. As for the gray color, it has a conservative, traditional, and decisive effect. This color will be used for the text color of the examples we will use in topics and other 
                    scientific studies [10].
                    The design is important for the usability of the website. The more user-friendly this voluntary activity is, the more participation it will attract. Using the information created on design to attract
                    people to this voluntary activity is aimed to achieve good results [9].</p>
                    <p class="lead">8. Conclusion</p> 
                    <p class="lead">The aim of the project, as the name suggests, is to overcome students' educational fears. If students can overcome their educational fears, they will be able to accomplish
                    great things, undertake major projects, specialize in their fields more easily, and look to the future with more hopeful eyes. With students producing good work, society will progress more rapidly.
                    In the field of education, there are similar initiatives available. What sets this project apart is its forum-style platform, which avoids content complexity, provides the opportunity to showcase 
                    any desired project (including smaller ones), is tailored to the private sector, places greater emphasis on engineering idea development, offers free education, allows working towards specific 
                    goals, and provides the opportunity to support or participate in these projects even after completing education.
                    <br /><br />The project will be kept flexible because in education, there should be the opportunity to incorporate newly learned solutions or analyses. The project is dynamic. Its content and 
                    design evolve or expand based on experiences or can be broadened with different fields.
                    The Education Fear Overcoming Project may appear static at the moment. However, with intense work over five to six years, it could evolve into an educational search engine. Knowledge multiplies
                    as it is shared and built upon. Within the scope of this project, we will strive to fulfill our responsibility of contributing to education with a sense of happiness in our hearts.
                    When considering the project in the future, its impact can be enhanced by leveraging different disciplines. By addressing the needs and concerns of students, the site can be further improved 
                    through research, observation, and collaboration in various fields. With increased support for the project, relationships between the industry and students can develop. For instance, companies 
                    can find suitable engineers to work with through the site, and students can discover firms where they can work effectively. With new ideas and experiences, the project will continue to 
                    evolve over time.</p>
