                    <br/>Description: With the designed system, data is collected from sensors placed in the locomotive's oil tank. These data are then stored in the database (or server) of 
                    the prepared website, enabling oil quality analysis based on the data, which is presented to the user via the website. Another feature of the system I designed is the 
                    retrieval of image footage from security cameras attached to the locomotive, which is then transferred to the server. Users can view these images through the website 
                    connected to the server. Additionally, the designed system records information such as the locomotive's location and speed in the database of the website, allowing users 
                    to view the data through the website. The system periodically generates data, including image footage, sensor data, and other information, every 5 minutes after the 
                    locomotive starts operating, and saves them to the server (database).</p>
