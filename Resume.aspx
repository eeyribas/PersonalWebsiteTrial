                    <br /><br /><b>Electronic Circuits, Power Electronics, and Switching Elements</b>
                    <br /><br /><b>Integrated Circuit Knowledge:</b> I have worked mainly with L / LM Series, TTL CMOS Series, MAX (Maxim) / MCP (Microchip) Series, and 
                    Optocoupler integrated circuits. In addition to these, I have worked on some types of integrated circuits. By looking at the datasheets of the integrated 
                    circuits, I can draw the appropriate circuit model and design the circuit. <br /><b>Electronic Circuits: </b>I have worked on Driver Cards, power 
                    circuits suitable for microcontrollers, and basic level amplifier circuits. Depending on the requirement of the project, I can perform circuit designs.

                    <br /><b>Electronic Card Design:</b> I can use the Proteus drawing program. But I do not have many drawings I have made.
                    <br /><br />In terms of electronics, the aim is to gain knowledge, skills, and experience according to the content of the project. In this sense, I aim 
                    to advance knowledge, skills, and experience. The programming languages ​​I enjoy using are PYTHON and C++ Programming Languages. ARM-Based Single Board 
                    Computers (SBCs) are the type of microcontroller that pushes the system in programming and tries to get the most out of the software at the highest levels.</p>
